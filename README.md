Objective:
Explore the Titanic dataset to gain insights into factors affecting passenger survival.

For this project, we will use a popular dataset - the "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including whether they survived or not, age, class, fare, etc.

Steps:

1. Data Loading:

  Import the necessary libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy).
  Load the Titanic dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. Data Overview:

  Display basic information about the dataset (columns, data types, missing values).

3. Descriptive Statistics:

  Generate descriptive statistics to understand the central tendency and dispersion of numerical features.

4. Data Visualization:

  Create visualizations to explore relationships and trends in the data.

5. Feature Engineering:

  Create new features or modify existing ones based on insights gained during exploration.

6. Survival Analysis:

  Explore factors influencing survival rates.

7. Correlation Analysis:

  Explore correlations between numerical features.
